Rice UI
=======

The Rice UI project contains common client side code (CSS, JS, Images, Icons, Fonts) for the [Kuali](http://www.kuali.org/) projects. The project provides a front end build process with common tasks defined, and incorporates other tools and standards for use in Kuali.

This project is maintained by a cross-project Kuali working group. For more information see the working group [charter](https://docs.google.com/a/kuali.org/document/d/1GCEo_pfKbgrXqe8A3XOAeEiL7hSxsbeo60lXmlX68IA/edit#heading=h.wphazq2qnmei).
